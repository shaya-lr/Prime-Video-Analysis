## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps Prime Video analyze its content and user feedback, enabling the platform to understand user preferences, satisfaction, and areas needing improvement. The dashboard provides insights into content popularity, user ratings, and viewing trends, allowing Prime Video to enhance user experience by identifying areas for improvement, such as content type, genre popularity, and viewing patterns.

Since more than 40% of users have rated content as neutral or dissatisfied, Prime Video should focus on optimizing its offerings, including genres and services with lower ratings.

### Steps Followed

- **Step 1**: Load Prime Video data (CSV) into Power BI Desktop.
- **Step 2**: Clean and transform the data using Power Query, checking data quality with "column distribution" and "column quality" options.
- **Step 3**: Addressed missing values by excluding them from calculations (e.g., ratings and runtime).
- **Step 4**: Added visual filters (slicers) for fields such as "Genre," "Region," and "Age Group."
- **Step 5**: Used card visuals to represent key metrics such as average ratings, total number of users, and viewing hours.
- **Step 6**: Created bar charts to display the number of users by satisfaction level, segregated by gender and age group.
- **Step 7**: Created a ratings visual to showcase user feedback on parameters like "Content Quality," "User Interface," "Streaming Speed," and "Customer Support."
- **Step 8**: Calculated average watch time, top-rated content, and genre preferences using DAX expressions.
- **Step 9**: Designed and formatted the dashboard using themes, text boxes, and images (e.g., Prime Video logo).
- **Step 10**: Published the report to Power BI Service for easy sharing and collaboration.
